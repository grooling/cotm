The Last War was a conflict that raged between Aundair, Breland, Cyre, Thrane, and Karrnath. Its original purpose was to determine which child would take the throne of the Kingdom of Galifar after the death of King Jarot in 894 YK. The conflict spiraled into a continent-wide war that lasted over a century, only ending after the destruction of the nation of Cyre in the Day of Mourning prompted the warring nations to sign the Treaty of Thronehold in 996 YK

The alliances seemed to be:

- Cyre and Aundair were allies, but Aundair recognizing Valenar as a nation broke that alliance. No real fighting between them though
- Breland and Thrane were allied
- Karrnath was on its own

The Kingdom of Galifar covered pretty much the whole continent before the war. All of the other minor kingdoms that now exist (Zilargo, Darguun, Valenar, etc.) all sprung up during or after the war
