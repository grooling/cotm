It was unusually hot when they awoke. They drank from their water skins.

There were no signs of civilization, though they saw ruins in the distance. Rik sent his hawk ahead, where it observed the remains of a lightning rail station. Zinnia changed into a swimsuit and a wide-brimmed hat. They traveled toward the station.

There were signs of combat. Blood and arrows were scattered around. Bariac could tell that the bloodstains were several years old and indicated that bodies had been dragged away. Petra and Rik uncovered a safe, four feet deep, containing bags and a desiccated gnome in a Lightning Rail uniform. The gnome held a pocket watch. The bags contained 150 gold pieces. The ghost of the gnome rose from the floor. He said he had been killed by Brelish soldiers. He asked if he could possess one of them to travel to Zilargo to see his family and say goodbye. He grew intense. Bariac threw holy water at him! (Daneel Thorn waist) They rolled for initiative!

Petra aged 10 years, and Nakaya aged 40 years, making her 55 years old. They defeated the ghost but remained aged. They would have to ask someone for help. They buried the gnome's corpse. The pocket watch lit up with divination under detect magic. Petra chipped off a 4-inch dragon shard from the lightning rail. She jumped back just before lightning struck where she had stood.

They traveled on for a bit before resting for the night (a short rest). The pocket watch of time and place was identified and owned by Bariac.

**Sar, Dravago 7, 998 YK**

There was a purple haze that morning. They encountered a battlefield where Brelish soldiers were frozen in time. Zinnia went around picking their pockets.

The battlefield appeared to be more of a brawl between Cyre and Breland. There was transmutation magic over the entire area, slowing time. There were spots where the magic was weaker, with no people in those areas. Bariac heard and saw a barking dog approaching. He detected no magic around it and fed it meat. The dog had supplies and a bag with a medical collar indicating it was with the Brelish army. Nakaya also gave the dog some meat and asked it to take them to its owner. The dog barked and ran off, and they followed.

The dog's owner had been frozen in time while being stabbed by a Cyran soldier. They dragged the Cyran off and removed his spear from the Brelish soldier. They dragged the soldier into a gap in the time-slowing magic, and he came back to life. They broke the news to him that Cyre had lost and that everyone was dead. He mentioned that he had a wife in Copperton. They tried to pull out other soldiers, including the dog owner. When the soldier looked over at the dog, he said, "But you're dead!" The dog then shifted into a hideous abomination. They rolled for initiative!
