**Sul, Dravago 1, 998 YK**

The group connected themselves with lengths of rope 10-15 feet long and held hands. As they drew nearer to the wall of fog, it made them feel tiny, and all sounds were muted. They began to hear strange things. Nakaya heard multiple instances of Hathar's voice coming from different directions and began to question which one was really him. Petra saw a figure to the leftâ€”it was her father. He called out her real name, "Liriel," and everyone heard it. Petra called out "Father?" Zinnia shot her pistol into the air, which brought Nakaya and Petra back, the bullet whizzing past Nakaya's head. Moving on, they saw weapons sticking out of the ground. The air was cold and thinner there, which slowed their travel somewhat. They emerged on the other side of the mist, near Greenland. Looking back, they noticed Rik muttering to himself, appearing a bit mad and uneasy. They saw odd things, including a multi-headed cow. Rik's madness eased later, and all he recollected from that time were odd hallucinatory memories.

**Mol, Dravago 2, 998 YK**

Nakaya noticed rain falling upwards from the mist. They saw a desiccated body floating in the air, holding a sword, and slowly floating in a circle. As they tried to avoid it, its head snapped towards them, and it drew a longbow. Roll initiative!

Their projectiles seemed to slow as they neared the corpse. Hathar ran to it and got sucked into a gelatinous cube within which the figure was suspended. They managed to escape successfully and traveled a bit more before camping for the night. They took the benefits of a short rest.

**Zol, Dravago 3, 998 YK**

The sky was purple. The plants in a nearby forest appeared to be made of flesh and hair. Hathar warned them not to cut them down and to avoid them. Zinnia threw a rock at him to test his blindness, but he caught it.

There was a red stream. Four trees, hundreds of feet tall, surrounded a town in the distance. Nakaya poked a flesh plant, and it shivered. Nakaya perceived something moving between the buildings in the town. Bariac noticed a gentle movement in the plants.

They entered the town of Steelspire. Nakaya was skipping joyfully. In the town center, they saw a large translucent figure searching the area.

The figure retrieved a keg from a tavern, biting into it. They saw chunks of the keg move through its digestive system. The figure pulled out one of its teeth and tossed it carelessly to the ground. Suddenly, the enormous mouth of an even larger creature emerged from the clouds and devoured the figure entirely, then walked off towards the northern horizon, only its huge legs visible under the cloud cover.

Nakaya searched a blacksmith's shop and found a longsword, which she saved to sell later. Bariac and Nakaya searched a tavern for supplies related to cooking and booze-making. They found Goliath Garnet wine. Petra and Berry checked an alchemist's shop, where they found a dozen vials, antitoxin, and a flask of holy water. Zinnia and Rik found 50 feet of rope and a healing potion at a general store.

They stayed three days to complete a long rest. Nakaya and Bariac went out to hunt and forage. Every creature they encountered was in terrible shape, but Berry eventually spotted a bear that appeared to be made of plant matter. It provided enough for two days' rations, so they only had to use one ration each from their stash.

They parted ways with Hathar.

**Far, Dravago 998 YK**

The group set out east. The group encountered a very wide chasm, 10-15 feet wide in places. Nakaya and Berry gazed down into it. They dropped a lit torch, but it fell endlessly. A female voice called out from the chasm, saying she was coming up. They saw a pale hand and snakes peeking out. Petra called for everyone to take cover, but Nakaya peeked out and caught the woman's eye, beginning to turn to stone. The medusa asked if she was okay. Nakaya lost a few scales but stopped turning to stone. She stepped out of cover towards the figure.

Zinnia peeked out and remembered medusas from her past. She told the medusa to cover her eyes. The medusa complied but recognized Zinnia. Zinnia had had bad dreams about her while traveling through the Mournland. Her name was Dal'erna, and she had helped Zinnia back then. Zinnia put heart-shaped sunglasses on the medusa, making it safe to look at her. Dal'erna complimented Zinnia's singing voice, and Zinnia felt assured she knew her. Dal'erna mostly stayed in Khyber (the Underdark). She had wares to sell. Dal'erna offered greater healing potions for 175 gp each and a Greater Restoration scroll, but the group couldn't afford anything.

Zinnia broke the news to Dal'erna that her gaze turned non-medusas into stone. She was very upset at this realization, though Zinnia comforted her. Dal'erna was attractive, and one of her snakes winked at Zinnia. The party received directions to her hometown for future reference so they could meet again. Dal'erna then repelled back down the chasm, and the group set off.
