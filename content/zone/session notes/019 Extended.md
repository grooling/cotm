**Sul Dravago 8, 998 YK**

The abomination dog and group fought. The beast killed its owner, a Cyran soldier, during the fight. The group defeated the dog abomination, though it took some oil and fire to keep it from resurrecting.

They helped Zinnia pull the remaining soldiers out of the magical effect. A Brelish captain thanked them and led his troops out of the Mournland and back to Breland. They gave them tips for safety and directions. Zinnia Rose learned that the dog's owner was named Teddic. She performed for the soldiers. Teddic had a pocket watch that was stopped at 2:38. She gave it to his peer in case he ran into Teddic's wife in Breland. Rik also played military songs using minor illusion, and Bariac cooked them a meal. They achieved a short rest, sleeping for the night. Nakaya and Petra gathered some pine tar to make alchemist's fire.

**Mol Dravago 9, 998 YK** 

They set out on a day with high gale wind and saw an odd sign: "Everything is normal!" Later, a few hundred feet further, another sign read: "Don't tell them the truth."

There was a town visible in the distance, populated and seemingly normal. They approached. 

They had arrived in Darry's Landing. A young boy, about eight years old, with gray skin and half of his face missing greeted them. Nakaya introduced him to Supercooled, her fox. There were traces of necromantic magic on [[Myles]], the boy. He suggested they visit Jerediah, the mayor. Rik and Nakaya bribed him to endear themselves to him, and coordinated with him. He would come to the location when he saw Rik’s hawk. He scampered off in the meantime.

As they went deeper into town, they saw many people in a similar state. A nobleman greeted them. He was [[Jerediah Semet]], the mayor. He recommended they visit [[Joe]]’s for food and rooms to sleep in. He mentioned a holy man, [[Sovereign Alexander]], and a magic practitioner, [[Annallisse]].

At Joe’s, the food smelled great. It cost 3 silver per person for three days. There was stew for 6 copper, and free meat for Supercooled. Nakaya gifted Joe some family wine. Bariac prayed over the meal and cast purify food and drink. It was delicious. Joe offered to pay them 10 gold to kill rats in the basement, to which they agreed. They spent three days mostly resting at Joe’s. Petra made a flask of alchemist’s fire.
