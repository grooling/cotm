Far Dravago 13, 998 YK

While traveling across the Mournland towards the Glass Plateau, Zinnia expressed hurt and anger at Bariac for calling the people of Darry's Landing abominations. He was deeply moved and apologized profusely. Petra argued that their humanity was exactly why their intervention was important. 

That night, Nakaya heard gurgling from Bariac and Rik's tent. She saw nude, slimy "clones" of each person, gasping for breath and dying. She called for everyone to wake up and come. A trail of slime led from Bariac and Rik, who were unconscious, to their clone corpses. Petra and Nakaya dragged the clones out of the tent and attempted to investigate them. They recalled the clone rats biting Bariac and Rik in Darry’s Landing and realized the connection. An hour later, the real two awoke, feeling normal.  They burned the deceased clones.

They approached the Glass Plateau, which stood over 100 feet tall. Zinnia recalled there hadn’t always been a plateau in Cyre. The plateau extended deep into the earth, revealed upon inspection with Mold Earth. Rik looked closely at the glass. He saw light flickering within it and momentarily felt drawn to it but shook it off. Rik sent Kairo up and observed that it stretched on for miles. The group levitated to the top and began traveling across it.  Zinnia managed to slide 30 feet across the glass. They camped out for a night, and in the darkness the rest of the group also witnessed the light flickering within the Glass Plateau.

As they continued to travel, there were no distinguishable features along the surface of the plateau. By midday, they saw a toppled stone structure and hurried over. It was a three-story tower lying on its side. A dragonborn skeleton, long dead, appeared to have crawled out of the second floor window. Its robes had withered with time, but it wore a papier-mâché mask depicting a ram. Gravity inside the tower reoriented Bariac, orienting him upright according to the tower's Transmutation-induced gravity. Everyone entered the dark building carefully. 

Bariac found a Dwarven cookbook that allowed him to create a Hero’s Feast and Petra found a spellbook titled Stanky Noptopper's Spells of Plenty, as well as another book with diagrams of metal constructs called Troberand's Machinations. Zinnia found 10 silver on one of many robed corpses in the area. Upstairs was an observation deck complete with a telescope, Zinnia pried a perfectly spherical ruby (worth 150 gp) off a lever, causing a large metallic construct to materialize. They rolled for initiative and successfully defeated it! Petra claimed a sapphire from the construct. They rested for three days within the tower before moving on (long rest).

The terrain which had been translucent glass eventually resembled obsidian as they walked further North across its surface. Deep within, they saw flashes of light and the tops of tents in the distance. The tents were at the edge of a 200-foot-wide sinkhole in the glass. The campsite was long abandoned, the fabric seemingly melded into the glass, and it appeared a few years old. They gave Kairo, Rik's familiar, a necklace of string, and Bariac cast Light on it. Kairo descended 500 feet and saw a cave. There were some sundries at the bottom and significant man-made paths leading down the walls of the sinkhole. It took an hour for everyone to safely travel down. 

They entered the natural cave, finding glowing crystals of various colors. Nakaya touched them, and they glowed brighter under her fingers. A camp, with building materials of Cyrian make, matched the paths they had taken down. The tools bore the crest of Cyre’s primary house, commissioned by Queen Dannel ir'Wynarn. Zinnia hummed to a crystal and heard a faint resonance. They found a keg of wine that was still good, drank it from vials, and Nakaya added the rest to the bag of holding. Zinnia recognized the wine from Metrol.

Inside a building sunk into the glass they found bedroom or living quarters. They found an open book on a desk that detailed an excavation of a 200-foot-tall metallic construct, similar but older than the Canniths’ similar monstrosities. It was made of adamantine and byeshk, and dated back to the Age of Monsters (about 40,000 years old). 

Deeper in the cave, they found the subject: a giant construct. An altar surrounded by a sigil held many glowing Siberys shards in receptacles connected to a crystal divination ball. When Nakaya touched the ball, her eyes glowed gold like the Siberys shards. The world around Nakaya faded as she felt a presence, seemingly larger than the construct, looking down at her, waiting. She said "hello" and felt its attention focus solely on her. When she asked, "Who are you?" there was no reply. She waved one hand and felt an emotion wash over her, like someone asking "what?" She looked down and saw a few glowing points of light in the bag of holding. She opened it and grabbed the first schema, a multi-pointed star, which transformed into a square in her hand. She asked what she was supposed to do with them. At that moment, they heard sliding metal as a chest compartment opened on the construct. Petra took the square schema and cast Levitate on herself. An aperture-like iris door opened, revealing a square slot, exactly the size of the schema. Nakaya felt a sense of anticipation as Petra placed the schema in the slot. It began to glow, the light spreading across mithril threads. Nakaya felt the presence's attention shift away from her and asked, "What happened?" A voice from all around answered: "The servant has begun the awakening."
