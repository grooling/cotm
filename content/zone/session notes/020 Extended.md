After a long rest in Darry's Landing, Petra gained the ability to cast _Augury_ using her orb. She divined that Annallisse seemed to know about the schema. Petra and the group visited her. Annallisse claimed she didn’t recognize the schema and revealed she was also from Aerenal, like Petra, and working as an alchemist. Zinnia and Petra bought perfume from Metrol. Annallisse had suffered an alchemy accident that scarred her face and had lost her husband in the same incident. She mentioned that the holy man had been experiencing a crisis of faith and had lost his ability to use holy magic. Rik bought some oil, and the group left to see the holy man to inquire about reversing Nakaya’s aging. Rik doubled back and crawled into Annallisse's chimney, overhearing her speak in Elvish while moving around her home. He noticed she had a basement cellar before retreating up the chimney.

At the Church of the Sovereign Host, Sovereign Alexander greeted the group. They asked about Nakaya’s ghost encounter, and he mentioned that his magic had been diminished. Bariac asked if he had lost his faith, but Alexander insisted he had not. He explained that the gods were simply not as present as they once were.

The group stepped out of town to discuss matters and came to an agreement, deciding they would likely reveal the full truth eventually.

They returned to Joe's place to deal with the rats. Nakaya noticed Annallisse was watching them from her tower window but quickly ducked away. Nakaya took a nap on the porch with Supercooled, while the group headed into Joe’s basement. Rik took two jars of moonshine from Joe’s distillery and encountered rats that multiplied like amoebas. _Roll initiative!_ (Doppelrats). They dispatched the multiplying rats and pocketed a pouch of magic components hidden in a crate of potatoes. It gave off an aura of Abjuration magic. Joe was upset when they lied about the rats breaking the moonshine, but he paid Rik 10gp Cyran currency. Bariac refused payment, he helped because it is the right thing to do.

They headed upstairs for dinner. Petra asked Bariac to inquire with Joe about Annallisse's husband. Joe revealed that her husband, Amrynn, had died three years ago in the same accident that scarred her. After dinner, they went to the graveyard but found no graves bearing his name, nor any graves that seemed recent.

Later that night, the group went to Annallisse’s place. Rik attempted to scale her tower while Zinnia, Petra, and the others approached the shop door and knocked. Annallisse made it clear she didn’t want them there. Petra tried to push in, but Annallisse resisted and locked the door. Petra then watched her shuffle off before _Misty Stepping_ inside to unlock the door for the rest of the group.

Rik sneaked into a tower window, finding himself in a bedroom with a desk. Petra sent a message to update Rik that Annallisse was on her way to him, and the group was inside her building. He found a component pouch similar to the one in Joe’s basement but then heard her approaching and hid under the bed.

Petra took four healing potions and an enchantment potion before the group moved to the cellar. They encountered abjuration magic at the foot of the stairs. Zinnia and Petra tried to go over the stairs to avoid it, but Zinnia drunkenly gymnast landed in the area affected by the magic. Rik heard an alarm go off, causing Annallisse to drop her book and rush toward the cellar.
