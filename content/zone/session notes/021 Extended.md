Rik sent a message to notify the group that Annallisse was coming. They attempted to hide, but she caught Bariac. Petra confronted her, and Annallisse snapped, revealing everything, preventing her from targeting Bariac with a spell. She was hoping to help the townspeople but didn’t cause the effect. When asked about the schema, she thought of a silver dragonborn, which she called “stupid.” She had held the schema for over a century. They inferred the silver dragonborn was Phaerix. After Barry’s persuasive words, she agreed to help them reverse the magic and give them the schema in exchange for ending her life. The schema was square. Phaerix had united her with Amrynn. He was passing through town and asked her to keep the schema safe. She mentioned that they had an accident in the lab. Afterward, she realized what was happening in the town, which drove her husband mad. She couldn’t help him, so she killed him. She didn’t know who or what had caused the events in the town.

They split up, informing the townspeople quickly and efficiently. Bariac tasked Annallisse with killing the children. Zinnia Rose ran away, unable to carry out the task. She covered her ears and hid under a tree. The group put most of the town to rest. Annallisse walked away from a burning building. The mayor and a few townsfolk initiated combat, as did Sovereign Alexander. They all fell to their ends.

Annallisse gifted the group 30 days of rations. She set her home ablaze, stating that she was going to be with Amrynn, walking into the burning building.
