# Locations

## The Broken Anvil Tavern
Located in the shady Callestan District of the Lower City, the sign on the exterior of this tavern bears the symbol of [[House Ghallanda]]. The proprietor is a cheerful Halfling woman. The clientele here seem a bit more well-to-do than the surrounding area would suggest.

The party and [[People/Lady Elaydren d'Vown|Lady Elaydren d'Vown]] met here.
## Nibbur's Fine Clothing
A tailor shop in Malleon's Gate, the Goblinoid slum district of the Lower City. The proprietor is a timid goblin tailor, [[Nibbur]], who has been having a lot of trouble lately with clientele. He is an informant for Rik Roper.

The party met [[Mandy]] here and intervened when he was being rude to Nibbur.
## Khyber's Gate
A housing district in the Upper Cogs ward of the Cogs region of Sharn, with monstrous folks making up the majority of the population.

[[Mandy]] told Zinnia she should head to Shamukaar there and ask for ‘something that can fuck her up’ and tell them Mandy sent her, should she ever be interested in working with [[Daask]].  
## House Cannith Ruins
Located below the sewer system of Dorasharn Tower in the E-213 Valve Cluster. These ruins are a Pre-Galifarian [[House Cannith]] meeting space, dating around 1000 years old. There is a temple to [[Onatar]] and a forge guarded by locked doors and mechanical dogs.

The party found the first [[Treasure/Schema|schema]] here and were ambushed by two members of [[The Blades]] who wanted it for themselves.
## Arguth's Artificery and Almonds
A magic item, magic item services, and locally-sourced nut shop in the Everbright District of the Middle City. The proprietor is an orcish fellow named [[Arguth]].

Arguth identified the broken arcane device that corrupted the Warforged and the schema. He promised to be discreet about the party having the items.
## Platform 38 Sharn Lightning Rail Station
The lightning rail station in Sharn.

The party met [[Chester]] here and purchased tickets to [[Sterngate]] on their way to visit locations from the [[Treasure/Ancient Map]].
