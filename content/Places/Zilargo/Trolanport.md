Trolanport is the capital city of Zilargo, built next to the Trolan River.

The party met Galin Springbranch the inquisitive gnome aboard the lightning rail on their way to [[Places/Darguun/index]]. He invited the group to visit him in Trolanport sometime. He secretly gifted them with brass dragon scales before departing.
