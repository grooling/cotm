# Backstory
Growing up in Droaam, Rik was hired by House Tharashk as a scout during the Last War. Sensing an opportunity to give a good name for monstrous folk everywhere, Rik opened up a licensed inquisitive agency in Sharn. He developed a knack for cracking cases for monstrous folk with nowhere else to turn. While he may rub the police the wrong way, they can't argue with his results.
