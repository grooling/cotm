# Backstory

Petra is a composed, courageous individual with a wry, sarcastic sense of humor. Her reverence for her ancestors fuels her love for history, science, and art. As a practitioner of magic, alchemy, tinkering, and cartography, Petra is a polymath, and relishes working odd jobs. 

A very long time ago, she was born in Aerenal, a small island continent off of Khorvaire and isolationist kingdom of elves. Her mother Thaera, was a playful professor of historical literature. Her father Belaereth, was a reserved antiquarian and cartographer. Petra underwent a century of rigorous schooling in Aereni arcane traditions and in her parents' disciplines. Eventually she began the strenuous process to become an educator like her mother. 

The family left Aerenal to tour across Eberron building a cache of awesome memories together. Thaera lectured on her specialty at numerous universities. Belaereth visited antiquarian societies building his collection of artifacts. Petra accompanied them both, and all together they visited historical sites of various cultures. As she saw more of the world, Petra began to reconsider her future in academia.

After Belaereth's untimely death, the family returned to Aerenal for a resurrection ritual. The Undying Court deemed Petra's father unneeded, and a funeral was held instead. Belaereth left behind an exceptionally ancient artifact: a metal orb with arcane symbols engraved inside many intricate compartments. After the ceremony, Petra left Aerenal, taking the orb with her. She spent the next few decades continuing to explore Eberron and starting to decipher the secrets of the relic. 

A burgeoning mage for wage, Petra found herself in The City of Towers, looking for work. She was regularly employed by The Towerkeepers Society. The group specialized in the preservation and exploration of the many towers that make up Sharn's iconic skyline. Its members studied the history of these structures, documented changes in the city's layout, and uncovered hidden chambers and forgotten secrets within. Working alongside folks from House Cannith's Tinkers Guild, she picked up a few skills and shared a few of her own. 

A while back, Petra got word that one Bonal Geldem, human provost of Morgrave University and professor of pre-Galifar studies, had been asking around about anyone interested in a funded expedition into the depths of Sharn. Petra knew she was perfect for the job, and made up her mind to meet him.
