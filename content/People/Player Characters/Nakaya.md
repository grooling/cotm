# Backstory

Nakaya grew up in a loving cottage near Stonepass in the Endworld Mountains, which separated Q'Barra and the Talenta Plains. She lived with her parents, brother, and grandparents. The family was very close. Meals were a special part of the day for her family, finding creative ways to cook meals with freshly gathered and hunted ingredients. They would all sit around the hearth and share stories while they ate, cherishing the time they had together. 

Rosette, her mother, and Dendrite, her grandmother (Rosette's mother), made and repaired clothing for the nearby villages. Her father, Rime, had a small vineyard and was a winemaker. RC (Rimed Crystals), Nakaya's brother, was following in his father's footsteps as he started to expand the vineyard. Fern, her grandfather (Rosette's father), helped with winemaking as he could, but he had become quite frail with his old age.  

Frost Flower, Nakaya's paternal grandmother, and Ukichiro, her grandfather, were the adventurers of the family. They hunted and collected food for the family to eat, teaching Nakaya the importance of understanding and respecting the environment around her. Frost Flower took a lot of time to help Nakaya learn how to properly skin an animal, fully use the meat and hide, while Ukichiro taught her about all the plants, mushrooms, and more in their are. Frost Flower and Ukichiro had met in a tavern when they were about Nakaya's age. She had always wanted to be an adventurer and was always checking out the local message board to see what adventures were out there. One day, while she was looking at the board, a handsome man walked up beside her, Ukichiro. Ukichiro was an adventurer and was checking out the local message board for people who may need his help. After talking a bit, Ukichiro invited Frost Flower to go with him for a nearby adventure to help a local family protect their livestock after repeated attacks from wolves. Frost Flower felt her dreams were coming true and invited herself on Ukichiro's next adventure. The two continued around the continent, making new friends along the way. Frost Flower fell pregnant with Rime and the two decided they needed to settle down. They found a plot of land in the countryside and decided they would stay there, living off the land. 

Nakaya loved to learn and spent as much time as she could listening to her family's stories and what they knew. She kept a journal containing everything she had learned over the years, especially the important things to stay alive like what mushrooms could and could not be eaten. As Nakaya spent time with Frost Flower and Ukichiro, they told her about the many adventures they had been on throughout their years together. Nakaya would listen in awe of all of the exciting things they were able to do, and dreamt of being an adventurer herself. She looked up to her grandmother who had decided what future she wanted and found a way to make it happen. The two talked about Nakaya's future in adventuring quite often, slowly leading Nakaya to make an adventuring plan similar to her grandmother's.
