# Bio
**Name:** Aya Albata <br />
**Race, Class, and Level:** Human Great Old One (Quori) Warlock 1 <br />
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good <br />
**Background:** Haunted One (Dreamer) <br />

**Personality Traits:**
- A hyperactive, mysterious weirdo with partial amnesia, severe chronic pain and neurological problems. Turns her excess energy into magic.
- Weird. So Weird. People think her head is a bit scrambled (it is). Talks to herself often.
- Very mistrustful of others, despite seeming naïve, inexperienced, and getting easily attached.
- Hopeful, determined, curious, scatter-brained, energetic, enthusiastic, silly.
- Haunted by memories of war and nightmares.

**Ideals:**
- Friendship. Everyone can be friends if you work at it! Bonds of friendship last forever. (Good)
- Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
- Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)
- No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic)

**Bonds:**
- Her patron is the person she is closest to and remembers best. Aya trusts her fully and her patron knows Aya would never betray her in turn.
- Doesn’t remember her past properly, nor which people might be waiting for her to remember them.
- Needs to understand what happened to her for the sake of her own sanity… and curiosity.
- Very attached to the company that has given her a home after her accident. (Couriers’ Guild)
- Is hounded by a stalker who takes great pleasure in messing with her sense of reality and safety.
- Will protect those who cannot protect themselves.
- No one else should have to endure the hardships she has been through.
- Wants to help her friend Petra find out more about her mysterious ancient relic.

**Flaws:**
- Struggles to differentiate between reality and fiction at times.
- Gets attached very quickly.
- Most people scream and run when they see a demon. Aya would take notes on its anatomy and favourite colour.
- Always in pain. So much pain. Doesn’t flinch as easily at acute injuries as a result.
- Not convinced that mindreading is an uncommon ability.
- Sometimes overlooks obvious solutions in favour of complicated ones.

# Backstory
An accident put her in a coma for several years. Only remembers roaming around the realms of dreams and madness before waking back up on Eberron. Doesn’t know her past but does know her patron very well. 

Is massively unfazed by many abhorrent or mind-addling beings and events due to her lengthy time spent in two dangerous and weird realms since she was younger. 

_**During coma (roughly 8 years):**_ While unconscious (her condition was curiously resistant to restoration magic), Aya wandered in the Realm of Dreams, Dal Quor. This is where she met her eventual patron – a quori who wants to pursue a third path for Dal Quor’s future, rather than those sought by the Dreaming Dark or the Path of Light and Kalashtar. 

While there, Aya was kidnapped from dreams by an unknown Daelkyr who became fascinated with her. He took her to Xoriat, the Realm of Madness for unknown reasons. She went a bit mad there, unable to be certain of what was real and what was not. 

_**After coma:**_ Her head is quite messed up by her time in Xoriat and the Realm of Dreams. Aya cannot remember her original life or family pre-accident, only knows it will all be there in her head, jumbled up with the rest of her dreamt and lived experiences in the other realms. 

She forged a pact with her quori friend as her Patron to help their quest from the Material Plane side. She warned Aya that the Daelkyr stalker is unlikely to leave her completely alone since he was weirdly fascinated/obsessed with her and some Daelkyr are just Like That, so she needs to be wary of him finding her again. 

Since reawakening back on the Material Plane, Aya has been looking for clues and knowledge on the different planes of their universe to help with her missing memories and to help achieve her and her Patron’s goals. 

Aya has been working with the Couriers Guild since waking up and greatly appreciates them for their support and accommodations. She is currently working in the City of Towers, where she has befriended a neighbour from the Tinker’s Guild named Petra studying the towers’ secrets. 

She freely speaks of her experiences and her stalker, even though such stories seem too grand, improbable, or even contradictory to be consistently believed.
