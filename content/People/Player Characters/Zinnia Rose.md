# Backstory

I was abandoned as a baby and left to the care of The Church of the Silver Flame and raised in the town of Rellekor. I began my career as an entertainer singing church hymns and was lauded for my angelic voice. The devil with the voice of the angel they used to say. When I reached adulthood I began to pursue acting and hooked up with a traveling vaudeville act that would entertain troops all over Eberron. Eventually a time came where I felt the need to breakout on my own and I left for the city of Sharn. 

(**Secret Backstory**) 
I am from Tronish and was there when The Mourning happened. I do not know what happened or how I survived but somehow I walked out from the mists on the eastern side of Cyre where I was picked up by the Darguun military. Malnourished and catatonic I gave no response for weeks, but I began to regain mobility of mind and body when I heard the accordion for the first time. That's how I found my calling as an entertainer. **Appearance:** Average height and thin with flawless pink skin like smooth strawberry ice cream. Flowing fuchsia colored hair that almost seems to move of its own accord. Tall semi-spiraling ivory white horns and ivory white nails with tiny hearts. Small tiny black heart tattoos below her eyes.
