# Backstory

I was abandoned as a baby and left to the care of The Church of the Silver Flame and raised in the town of Rellekor. I began my career as an entertainer singing church hymns and was lauded for my angelic voice. The devil with the voice of the angel they used to say. When I reached adulthood I began to pursue acting and hooked up with a traveling vaudeville act that would entertain troops all over Eberron. Eventually a time came where I felt the need to breakout on my own and I left for the city of Sharn. 

> [!Warning]- Secret Backstory
> I am from Tronish and was there when The Mourning happened. I do not know what happened or how I survived but somehow I walked out from the mists on the eastern side of Cyre where I was picked up by the Darguun military. Malnourished and catatonic I gave no response for weeks, but I began to regain mobility of mind and body when I heard the accordion for the first time. That's how I found my calling as an entertainer.

# Notes

Zinnia revealed that she is from Tronish in the Mournland. She shared her sketchbook, where she draws scenes from Tronish from memory. Zinnia was traumatized by the Day of Mourning, when she lost a lot of loved ones. She seems to have walked west across all of the Mournland before ending up in Darguun.


# Connections

**Zinnia shared a drawing of her parents:**
Delina Mara (tiefling mother)
Susana Mara Rose (human mother)

Zinnia is familiar with the **4th Skullbiters Company of the Darguun Military**. We met one member: a hobgoblin named Vregal "Fast Willy" from the tribridge borough. 

Zinnia doesn't remember it very clearly, but after the Mourning she was helped by a medusa traveling merchant in the Mournland named [[People/Dal'erna]].
