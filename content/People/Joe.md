Chef and tavernkeeper of Darry's Landing. He had an enormous abscess on his throat. He gave no indication that he was aware of the state of his decay. He charged the group members each 3sp to sleep three nights, and 6cp to eat a bowl of delicious chicken gumbo. 

Nakaya gifted him her last bottle of her family's wine, which he was excited to use in his cooking. He said there have not been wine shipments in a long time.

Joe asked for help killing the rats in his basement, which he had been unsuccessful in getting rid of. The rats are probably affected by the same Necromantic magic keeping the townspeople alive. He offered 10g in payment, to which the group agreed.
