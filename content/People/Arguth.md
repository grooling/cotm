Arguth identified the broken arcane device that corrupted the Warforged, he noticed it was missing a dragonshard power source and was not created by House Cannith. It originally affected all but had been tuned to affect only Warforged. He said it would cost 200 gold pieces to fix.

He also identified the "heirloom" to actually be a rare, ancient schema for a giant mechanical clawed arm. Arguth knew Lord Cannith was working on things like this, but nothing quite as sophisticated. He thinks it could go for anywhere from hundreds to tens of thousands of gold pieces. 

He promised to be discreet about the party having the items.
