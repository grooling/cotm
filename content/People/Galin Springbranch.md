Met on the Lightning rail train

Was muttering to himself, remarking on Kanxith and party members as they entered the dining car

He said to visit him if we are ever in Trolanport, Zilagro. He left a brass dragon scale in each of our pockets (save Aya who didn't feel comfortable hugging him goodbye).
