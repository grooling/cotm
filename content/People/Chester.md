Dramatic clown that recognized [[People/Player Characters/Aya Albata|Aya]], saying they go way back. The party first encountered him at the [[Places/Sharn#Platform 38 Sharn Lightning Rail Station]] in Sharn. Aya denied knowing him, and told him he must be confusing her with a twin sister. Aya lied to him and said she's headed to Karrnath, he said he's headed there as well! Petra noticed he wields a staff topped with a smaller version of his own head. It matches his expressions but moves just slightly before Chester's actual face.

Later, Chester confronted Zinnia aboard the train. He tried to give her a wrapped present to give to Aya. Zinnia told him to fuck off and mind his own business. Upon discovering it was from Chester, Aya threw the present off the moving train without opening it. Aya revealed to the party that she met Chester when she was an acrobat, and that Chester is a [[Compendium/Daelkyr|daelkyr]] that is stalking her across dimensions. He can change appearances and sometimes send subordinates to mess with her. Aya says if a stranger asks the party if they are friends of Aya, to deny it.

Most recently, Chester left a calling card in Khraal.
