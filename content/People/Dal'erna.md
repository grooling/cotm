Dal'erna is a medusa traveling merchant who helped Zinnia traverse the Mournland after the Day of Mourning. Zinnia only has dreamy, foggy memories of that time. 

The group encountered a wide chasm in the Mournland, and after they tossed a lit torch into it, Dal'erna crawled out to the surface. She accidentally almost turned Nakaya to stone when they made eye contact. Dal'erna learned from Zinnia Rose that medusas' gaze turn non-medusas to stone. Zinnia masterfully lied to comfort Dal'erna, saying all the statues that she encountered definitely weren't her fault.

She had some wares for sale, two Greater Healing Potions discounted to 150 GP each, and a Scroll of Greater Restoration. Zinnia advised her to keep that scroll in case she turned anyone to stone. The group couldn't afford her wares. Dal'erna told Zinnia directions to get to her hometown in Khyber so they could meet again in the future.
