Artificer dwarf with a mechanical arm, likes hugging  
  
Lives in a cramped workshop in The Cogs district

He thinks House Cannith East's use of undead is creepy  
  
We showed him the schema, journal, and ring  
  
The mechanical arm from the schema reminded him of the Colussi used in the war, but even more complicated

Childhood friend of [[Kanxith Grexhan|Kanxith]]'s  
  
Member of [[House Cannith]] South
