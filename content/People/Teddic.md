Teddic was a soldier fighting on behalf of Cyre, who had been suspended in time in a battlefield.

While traveling through the Mournland, the group encountered a magically frozen battlefield full of brawling soldiers. Then, a dog led them to Teddic when Nakaya asked the dog where is its owner. 

The group pulled Teddic from the magical effect, releasing him from the spell. He was devastated to learn about the outcome of the war, that Cyre and everyone in it had been lost. He had a wife in **Copperton**. 

Then, he looked to the dog and was confused as he stated it had previously died. The dog transformed into an abomination and attacked. The dog killed Teddic before the group was able to defeat it.

Zinnia found a pocketwatch that was stopped at 2:38 on his person. She asked the other Cyran soldiers what his name was, and gave it to his peers in case they ran into Teddic's wife in Breland.
