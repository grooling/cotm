Mayor of [[Darry's Landing]], Jerediah greeted the group as they entered the town center. He recommended [[Joe]]'s for food and beds to rent. He also mentioned [[Sovereign Alexander]] the town holy man, and a magic practitioner named [[Annallisse]].

Similarly to [[Myles]], he did not acknowledge his state of decay.
