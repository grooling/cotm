Human noblewoman that hired the party to find her family heirloom: an adamantine plate shaped like a seven-pointed star. Kanxith noticed she was wearing a [[Factions/House Cannith|House Cannith]] signet ring. She works with House Cannith West. She originally hired [[Bonal Geldem]] to help find her family heirloom. 
  
Seems to have a very competent bodyguard, who knocked Rik out when he tried to pursue Lady d'Vown after the first meeting at [[Places/Sharn#The Broken Anvil Tavern|The Broken Anvil]].
