Young boy of about eight years old that greeted the group when they entered [[Darry's Landing]]. He has grayish tint to his complexion and half of the skin on his face was missing. He gave no indication that he was aware of the state of his decay.

Myles suggested we speak to [[People/Jerediah Semet|Jerediah Semet]], the mayor he described as somewhat bossy but very knowledgeable.

Rik and Nakaya endeared Myles to the group, using bribes of cigarettes and rides on Supercooled, and so he agreed to keep an eye out for Rik's hawk familiar and come to the location it signaled with its flight.

Petra detected a faint aura of Necromancy magic on Myles. She asked him if he knew of any ruins or caverns in town, but he didn't. Rik showed him an illusory image of a schema, and he had not seen anything resembling it either.
