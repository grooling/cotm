Tattered map from [[Places/Breland/Sharn#House Cannith Ruins|House Cannith ruins]] beneath the Sharn sewers. The map was an ancient depiction of the territory now divided between the Mournland and Darguun. The group researched it for a week at the library. There were five locations marked with Xs, labeled with cryptic symbols. The party were unsure of the symbols' meaning, but decided to go to Darguun to investigate and seek out further [[schema|schemas]].

They referenced it against a modern map.
