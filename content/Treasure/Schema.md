## Seven Pointed Star
Discovered in [[Places/Sharn#House Cannith Ruins|House Cannith Ruins beneath Sharn]]. Stolen from Lady Elaydren d'Vown. Identified by [[People/Arguth|Arguth]] who revealed it was a very rare object containing a schema. After a couple days work, he activated the schema, revealing a hologram of a giant mechanical clawed arm, with words resembling binary flitting about.

The mechanical arm from the schema reminded [[Tumrek d'Cannith]] of the Colussi used in the war, but even more complicated. He confirmed that it is a weapon.
