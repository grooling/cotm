*Weapon (any bow or crossbow), uncommon*
*(requires attunement)*

Wrought from metal in the likeness of a brazier, this ranged weapon's grip has been covered in wax and has a simple candle positioned in front of where the arrow or bolt is fired from. The candle is magic and never runs out of wax, nor can it be removed from the weapon. You can use a bonus action to speak the weapon's command word to cause the candle to light itself, shedding bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet while it's ablaze. While the candle is lit, this magic weapon deals an extra 2 fire damage to any target it hits with a ranged attack. The candle's flame lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. 

If you roll the same number on both d20s when you make a ranged attack roll with advantage or disadvantage using this weapon while its candle is lit, the ammunition becomes wreathed in a conflagration of uncontrollable flames. The arrow or bolt flies toward the target and explodes, destroying the ammunition and dealing 4d6 fire damage to the target on a hit (instead of the attack's normal damage), or half as much damage if the result of the attack roll was less than the target's AC. This fire ignites flammable objects within 5 feet of the target that aren't being worn or carried. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
