A flat box with no clear button to turn it on, and no maker's markings on it. It is cracked and broken and inside some crystals can be seen. 

[[Arguth]] identified it for us for 25 gold pieces. He noticed it was missing a dragonshard power source and was not created by House Cannith. It originally affected anyone but had been tuned to affect only Warforged. He said it would cost 200 gold pieces to fix.
