The dog had no magical aura to him, but shifted into a hideous abomination once the owner said that he thought the dog was dead. The dog abomination killed its owner during combat. 

The monstrosity healed itself and resurrected when it was slain, and Rik knew it would take fire or acid to keep it from resurrecting.
