After a long rest in Darry's Landing, Petra used *Augury* to divine that [[Annallisse]], a scarred alchemist from Aerenal, might know about the schema, though Annallisse denied recognizing them. After investigating Annallisse's home, Rik overheard her speaking in Elvish and noticed a hidden basement. The group discovered that [[Sovereign Alexander]] had lost most of his connection to divine magic. Later, the group fought [[Compendium/Doppelrat|multiplying rats]] in Joe's basement and uncovered a magical component pouch. That night, they infiltrated Annallisseâ€™s tower and basement, triggering an alarm as they searched her cellar, which was protected by abjuration magic.
# Handouts and Highlights
