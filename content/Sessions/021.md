The party confronted [[Annallisse]], who revealed that she had been hiding a schema for over a century, at the request of the silver dragonborn named [[Phaerix]]. After a lab accident, she and her husband uncovered the grim truth of [[Darry's Landing]], which drove Amrynn into a deep madness. Despite her efforts to save him, Annallisse ultimately released Amrynn from his suffering through death. She then devoted herself to protecting the townsfolk from a similar fate. In exchange for her own death, Annallisse gave the [[schema]] to the group and helped them end the townsfolks' false semblance of life. Following mass-euthanasia and a final confrontation in the town center, Annallisse set her home ablaze and walked into the flames to reunite with her lost love, Amrynn. As dawn broke over Darry's Landing, the group finished burying the townspeople.
