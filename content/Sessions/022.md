Traveling through the Mournland toward the Glass Plateau, the group encountered even more strange phenomena. After a tense moment between Zinnia and Bariac over his calling the undead of Darry's Landing abominations, they investigated disturbing clones of Rik and Bariac that appeared in the night. The party then reached the mysterious Glass Plateau and explored a toppled tower where they found treasure and faced a metallic construct. Continuing across the surface of the plateau, they discovered an ancient excavation site containing a massive, ancient construct. Nakaya connected with a powerful presence and Petra inserted the first schema into its chest, beginning the construct's awakening.

*Nakaya communes with an enormous sentience after touching the crystal ball in the cave.*
# Handouts and Highlights
- Bariac got a cookbook that allows one casting of Hero's Feast! Petra found a spell book and book of diagrams of metal constructs! Zinnia found a ruby worth 150 GP! Nakaya got a keg of wine from Metrol!
- A journal found within the cave at the Glass Plateau appears to be dated in the months leading up to the Day of Mourning ![[_assets/media/Handouts/Cave Journal.png]]
- The Queen of Cyre - Dannel ir'Wynarn - commissioned the excavation into the sinkhole
- We found the 40,000+ year-old, 200 foot tall entity connected to the schemas!!
# Quests and Questions
- Continue speaking with ancient sentience
- Add more schemas to chest compartment
- What caused the sinkhole which predated the Glass Plateau?
- How and by whom was this site struck, ostensibly resulting in the Day of Mourning and creating the Glass Plateau?
- Reverse Nakaya's sudden aging
- Why was Phaerix hiding the schemas a century ago?
