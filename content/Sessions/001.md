In a bustling [[Places/Sharn]] marketplace, six individuals unite following the murder of [[Bonal Geldem]], his [[People/Mystery Killer|assailant]] shouting "For the [[Factions/The Blades|Blades]]!" and deploying a [[Treasure/Arcane Corruption Device|device]] that turns nearby [[Compendium/Warforged|warforged]] hostile. Prompted by a mysterious note, they convene with [[People/Lady Elaydren d'Vown|Lady Elaydren d'Vown]], who tasks them with retrieving her family [[Treasure/Schema|heirloom]], an adamantine plate shaped like a seven-pointed star.
