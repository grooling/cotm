Traveling into a [[Places/Darguun]] mountain range with [[Uvlar]]'s mercenaries, the party scouts ahead in the mountains, encounter charming [[Compendium/Harpy|harpies]], and manage to kill one while the other fleed. They report back to camp and everyone takes the safer path for a few more days of travel. After receiving some pay, they split off from Uvlar's mercenaries and find ancient trails leading to a ruined village with a Dwarven sigil for Clan Ashmaker. Entering the ruins, they attempt to sneak past singing goblins but are discovered when Nakaya trips over an old set of Dwarven armor.
