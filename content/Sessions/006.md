At the start of a three day train ride to Darguun, Rik, Kanxith, and Zinnia Rose encounter a [[People/Galin Springbranch|curious gnome]] who observes "train passengers" in the dining car. Nakaya, Aya, and Petra meet a [[House Vadalis]] member who has lost track of his snake on the train. This snake turns out to be extraordinary- with multiple mage hands it escapes its enclosure and begins robbing train passengers! The party chases the snake down, culminating in a fight between the snake and skeletons crawling from a [[Treasure/Bag of Holding|bag]].
