Kanxith was given a proper burial, and the party said their final words. Setting out south, they encountered some commotion and approached cautiously. Bariac Cast-Ironfist, cleric of Boldrei, emerged from his food cart with a cast iron pan, yelling at bandits and their pet [[Compendium/Manticore]] as they threatened him. Everyone defeated the bandits and manticore and introduced themselves. It was decided that they would team up and take Berry's food cart as they continued south.
