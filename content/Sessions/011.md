Kanxith gets a proper burial and the party says their final words. Setting out South, they encounter some commotion and approach cautiously. Bariac Cast-Ironfist, cleric of Boldrei, comes out of his food cart with a cast iron pan yelling at bandits and their pet [[Compendium/Manticore]] as they threaten him. Everyone defeats the bandits and manticore, and introduces themselves. It is decided, we will team up and take Berry's food cart as we continue south.
