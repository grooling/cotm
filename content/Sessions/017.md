[[Hathar]] led the group eastward through the dead-gray mist which distorted perception and reality. Trekking on, they defended themselves against a desiccated undead corpse suspended within a gelatinous cube. After entering a forest of plants with humanoid flesh and hair that shivered to the touch, they discovered [[Steelspire]], an empty, ruined town where they parted ways with Hathar. After a few days of rest, looting supplies, hunting, and foraging, they set out again where they met [[Dal'erna]], a medusa from Zinnia's past.

*Zinnia's old friend, Dal'erna the medusa hiker crawled out of a chasm in the Mournland*
# Handouts and Highlights
- Zinnia shot her pistol to snap Nakaya and Petra out of their hallucinations, though Rik experienced some madness for the better part of a day
- Rain fell upwards from the mist, into Bariac's kilt and Zinnia's petticoats
- An ogre with transparent skin visibly digested chunks of keg wood before being devoured by a monstrosity too large to fully see through the cloud cover
- Nakaya and Bariac hunted and foraged a six-legged bear made of plant matter that fed us for days
- Dal'erna was distraught to learn that her gaze turned non-medusas to stone, though Zinnia comforted her
# Quests and Questions
- Move towards the marked location on the map, seeking another schema
- Beware of the horrors of the Mournland. At least it might deter all the people who are after us...
