In the entry hall of a dark temple, the group stood on tiled columns baring symbols, following with nearby tablets that listed the achievements of Delzer the Warmonger, unlocking a door. They encountered traps, kobolds, levers, more symbol puzzles, and mechanical monsters, resulting in fights where Petra was knocked unconscious and Bariac gravely injured. They eventually met Cepha, a dragon, who warned them about the dangers of seeking the schematics. They may be connected to a secretive dragon association from Argonnessen known as The Chamber.
