**Zor, Therendor 5, 998 YK**

After preparing for their sewer expedition, the party visits Nibbur's Fine Clothing. [[Nibbur]] directs them to Skakan's Rat Market, and [[Skakan]] leads them to the sewer entrance. In the sewer, they fight two [[Compendium/Shifter|shifters]] and a hooded [[warforged]] figure. After the enemies flee or perish, the group takes a short rest. They discover a hatch that reacts to [[People/Bonal Geldem|Bonal Geldem]]'s journal and leads to an old [[House Cannith]] location.
