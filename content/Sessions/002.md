**Zor, Therendor 5, 998 YK**

After preparing for their sewer expedition, the party visited Nibbur's Fine Clothing. [[People/Nibbur|Nibbur]] directed them to Skakan's Rat Market, and [[People/Skakan|Skakan]] led them to the sewer entrance. In the sewer, they fought two [[Compendium/Shifter|shifters]] and a hooded [[Compendium/Warforged|Warforged]] figure. After the enemies fled or perished, the group took a short rest. They discovered a hatch that reacted to [[People/Bonal Geldem|Bonal Geldem]]'s journal and led to an old [[Factions/House Cannith|House Cannith]] location.
