The party visited Kanxith's friend [[Tumrek d'Cannith]], who noticed a resemblance between the mechanical arm from the [[schema]] and the Colussi used in the war. At the Broken Anvil, Aya and Kanxith convinced [[Lady Elaydren d'Vown]] that the [[Factions/The Blades|Blades member]] made off with the artifact. Researching the tattered map at the Library for a week revealed its modern day locations in [[Places/Darguun]]. At the [[Places/Sharn#Platform 38 Sharn Lightning Rail Station]], a strange clown called [[Chester]] claimed to know Aya, though she felt unsettled and unsure of who he was.
