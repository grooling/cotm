The group traveled many days to Brokentooth, where they paid Bariac for his hard work, shared personal stories, and decided to push into the Mournland to continue collecting schemas. They traveled many more days to Lyrenton, where they met [[Hathar]], an experienced wayfinder they hired to guide them into the Mournland. As they approached it, they saw the dead-gray mist, and faces within it displaying unsettling expressions.
