Still aboard the lightning rail, [[Edrin]], the cleric from the [[Factions/Church of the Silver Flame]], explained his deity-less religion to a confused Nakaya and Petra. Zinnia apologized to [[People/Victor d'Vadalis|Victor d'Vadalis]], attempted to charm him, and failed to push him off the train, leading Victor to call her crazy. Later, Chester gave Zinnia a box for Aya, who revealed [[Chester]] as a dimension-stalking [[daelkyr]]. The group switched trains in Sterlasker, parted with [[Galin Springbranch]], and planned their route. In [[Places/Breland/Sterngate]], they bought supplies, joined [[Uvlar]]â€™s Mercenaries, and prepared to depart at dawn.

# Handouts and Highlights
- Zinnia Rose is a bit of a loose cannon!  
- [[Chester]] the Jester is incessant, what's in the box?!  
- Aya used to be an acrobat, that is where she met Chester.
- Thackery the donkey is a bit rude  
- [[People/Galin Springbranch|Galin]] gave us (besides Aya) a brass scale each, why?
