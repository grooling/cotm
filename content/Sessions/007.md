**Zol, Therendor 17, 998 YK - Wir, Therendor 18, 998 YK**
Still aboard the lightning rail, [[Edrin]], the cleric from the [[Factions/Church of the Silver Flame]], explains his deity-less religion to a confused Nakaya and Petra. Zinnia apologizes to [[People/Victor d'Vadalis|Victor d'Vadalis]], attempts to charm him, and fails to push him off the train, and Victor calls her crazy. Later, Chester gives Zinnia a box for Aya, who reveals [[Chester]] as a dimension-stalking [[daelkyr]]. The group switches trains in Sterlasker, parts with [[Galin Springbranch]], and plans their route. In [[Places/Sterngate]], they buy supplies, join [[Uvlar]]â€™s Mercenaries, and prepare to depart at dawn.

# Handouts and Highlights
- Zinnia Rose is a bit of a loose cannon!  
- [[Chester]] the Jester is incessant, what's in the box?!  
- Aya used to be an acrobat, that is where she met Chester.
- Thackery the donkey is a bit rude  
- [[People/Galin Springbranch|Galin]] gave us (besides Aya) a brass scale each, why?
