After defeating a gibbering mouther and a dolgrim at the Jungle Ruins, the party began hearing mysterious whispers. They witnessed an illusory message from Cepha, scourge of the Khraal, revealing she had taken everything of value from the ruins. The party tried to follow kobold tracks but failed to locate Cepha and made camp for the night in the jungle. During Nakaya's watch, Stur and eight of the Limb Choppers circled the party but ultimately gave directions to Cepha's lair. Once there, the party agreed to a trial to win back their "belongings" from Cepha.
