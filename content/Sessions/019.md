The dog abomination killed its owner, a Cyran soldier named [[Teddic]], before the group defeated it using oil and fire to prevent its resurrection. Afterward, they aided effort to remove the remaining soldiers from the time stopping magical effect. Zinnia and Rik entertained the troops and Bariac cooked for everyone. They gave the soldiers directions and advice to safely leave the Mournland on their way to Breland. The following day outside an unusually lively village the group encountered signs instructing "don't tell them the truth". They arrived in [[Darry's Landing]], where they encountered necromantic townsfolk and their mayor [[People/Jerediah Semet|Jerediah Semet]]. They arranged to stay at [[Joe]]â€™s while resting and preparing for their next actions.

# Handouts and Highlights
- Teddic's pocketwatch was stopped at 2:38
- Roughly made signs outside of Darry's Landing read, "Everything is normal" and "Don't tell them the truth"
- Rik bribed [[Myles]] with cigarettes (emptied then filled with tinder shavings) and Nakaya offered him a ride on Supercooled
- Joe makes really good chicken gumbo despite there not being any chickens in sight
- **Leveled up to level 4 during long rest at Joe's**
# Quests and Questions
- Reverse Nakaya's sudden aging
- Kill Joe's basement rats for 10g
- Who put up the signs outside Darry's Landing? Why do the townspeople think everything is normal?
- Darry's Landing is a marked location on our map, so where's the schema?
