Traveling south through Darguun, the party encountered a goblinoid checkpoint where Zinnia's performance charmed the guards, allowing Rik to lift a firearm before they proceeded on their journey. In Rhukaan Draal, the capital of Darguun, they bypassed an ogre guard with Bariac's cooking, visited several shops, and acquired supplies. Approaching Khraal, Zinnia received an [[Treasure/Snail shell necklace|enchanted gift]] from a [[Chwinga]], the group discovered ancient Dhakaani ruins, and encountered a mouth-covered beast emerging from the jungle.
