Traveling south through Darguun, the party encounters a goblinoid checkpoint where Zinnia's performance charms the guards, allowing Rik to lift a firearm before they proceed on their journey. In Rhukaan Draal, the capitol of Darguun, they bypass an ogre guard with Bariac's cooking, visit several shops, and acquire supplies. Approaching Khraal, Zinnia receives an enchanted gift from a Chwinga, the group discovers ancient Dhakaani ruins, and encounter a mouth-covered beast emerging from the jungle.
