In the ruins of a lightning rail station, the group uncovered a floor safe containing bags of money, a desiccated gnome lightning rail worker, and a [[Treasure/Pocketwatch of Time and Place|magical pocket watch]]. [[Daneel Thornwaist]]'s ghost was intensely desperate to possess someone so he may travel and say goodbye to his family in Zilargo. Bariac tossed holy water at him starting a fight, in which Nakaya was aged 40 years by the ghost. The next day, they stumbled onto a battlefield magically suspended in time. A seemingly normal dog led them to its frozen [[Teddic|owner]], and the group began to pull soldiers out of the time halting magic effect. The dog transformed into an [[Compendium/Dog abomination|abomination]] after the recovered owner recognized it had already died.
