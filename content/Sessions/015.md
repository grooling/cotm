Cepha taught the party about The Chamber, and asked for a favor in exchange for the schema she had. Suddenly, The Blades attacked wanting to kill Aya and take the schemas. Rik, in disguise, retrieved valuable items from Cepha's hoard while she was distracted. The rest of the party aided Cepha, fighting an orcish figure they recognized as Bonal Geldem's masked murderer, though he teleported away after sustaining some injuries. Cepha deemed her favor had been paid, and the group quickly left Cepha's "kingdom" before she realized some of her hoard was missing.

# Handouts and Highlights
- Zinnia's pretty sure Cepha and Galin Springbranch used to be a thing.  
- Rik single-handedly snuck into a Dragon's hoard and made off with some sweet loot.  
- The Mystery Killer of Bonal Geldem returned!  
- Zinnia is writing a song about Cepha the green dragon.
# Quests and Questions
- Bariac has been a life saver, we can give him Kanxith's wealth in exchange for his work and continuing to stay
- Who is the Orcish man that killed Bonal Geldem? Is he truly a follower of The Blades or has he "hacked" some of their members to work for him?  
- Is Chester always following us? Is he good or bad?  
- Should we carry on looking for the other schemas now that we know people are hunting us/the schemas?  
- What do we do with the schemas after all of this?
