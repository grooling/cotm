Exploring the [[Places/Sharn#House Cannith Ruins|ruins]] of an underground Pre-Galifarian [[House Cannith]] location, the party encounters a temple to [[Lore/Onatar]], god of artifice and the forge. Deeper still, they encounter a forge with a puzzle-protected compartment. Inside is loot including the [[Treasure/Schema|heirloom]]. Leaving after several close calls, they encounter two [[Factions/The Blades|Blades]] members, and the discarded mask of the [[People/Mystery Killer|mysterious figure]] that killed [[Bonal Geldem]].
