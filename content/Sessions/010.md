Defeating the [[Compendium/Ankheg]], the party pushed deeper into the tunnels, revealing an ancient Dwarven tomb. Inside, Petra and Kanxith pilfered many sarcophagi of the Ashmaker clan. Rik discovered jugs containing snakes, which attacked the party and ultimately killed Kanxith. Grieving, the party took a short rest before dividing his belongings. Petra solved three riddle doors, clearing the way back to the King's chamber. Carrying Kanxith's remains, they traded King Werd for his crown using a transmuted paper crown, securing the schema before being kicked out of the ruins by King Werd and the goblins.
