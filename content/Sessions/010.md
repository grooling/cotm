Defeating the [[Compendium/Ankheg]], the party pushes deeper into the tunnels revealing an ancient Dwarven tomb. Inside, Petra and Kanxith pilfer many sarcophagi of the Ashmaker clan. Rik discovers jugs containing snakes, which attack the party and ultimately kill Kanxith. Grieving, the party short rests before dividing his belongings. Petra solves three riddle doors clearing the way back to the King's chamber. Carrying Kanxith's remains, they trade King Werd for his crown using a transmuted paper crown, securing the schema before being kicked out of the ruins by King Werd and the goblins.
