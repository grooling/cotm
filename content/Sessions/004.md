Taking some time to sell some of the loot, the party stocks up on some supplies. They visit a magic item shop to learn more about the arcane device and adamantine artefact. They learn it is a schema for a giant mechanical clawed arm and decide to check back in with [[People/Lady Elaydren d'Vown|Lady Elaydren d'Vown]], but omit parts of the story in case [[House Cannith]] West wants it for nefarious purposes.
