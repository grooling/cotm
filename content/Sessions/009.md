The group convincing the goblins they are not a threat, ends up negotiating with [[Great King Werd]] to clear the lower levels of "Burny Ones" in exchange for a magical [[schema]] on his crown. After buying a Scroll of Frost Fingers from [[Clurd the Booyagh]], they descend into the fiery lower level that seems to be a manifest zone of Fernia (Plane of Fire). Battling explosive fire creatures, Petra and Aya fall unconscious, but make full recoveries. the group discovers a Dwarven journal, a magical [[Treasure/Candleflame Bow|Candleflame Bow]], and an [[Compendium/Ankheg]] deeper in the tunnels.
# Handouts and Highlights
- Petra and Aya died in battle but were restored  
- There seems to be one good potion in Clurd's collection...  
- Zinnia taught the goblins how to twerk and say "Nasty!"
- The Dwarven journal belonged to Burbon of Clan Ashmaker. Inside he detailed a deadly intrusion of the Dwarven citadel over the schema.  
- Burbon also crafted the Candleflame Longbow, now Nakaya's
